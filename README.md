**Django Test Instruction***
Hi there! You are going to make edits on a public Django project. The django project is a super simple version of Reddit. Note that the repo uses terminology that differs from Reddit terminology. You are going to make a clone of the project and finish the following specific tasks:

1. Git clone https://github.com/nikolak/django_reddit
2. Make it work.
   There are a couple bugs in the repo. Depending on your version, you are very likely to occur bugs. We expect you to fix these bugs and make the original code run.
