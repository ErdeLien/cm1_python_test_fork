**Django Test Instruction***
Hi there! You are going to make edits on a public Django project. The django project is a super simple version of Reddit. Note that the repo uses terminology that differs from Reddit terminology. You are going to make a clone of the project and finish the following specific tasks:

1. Git clone https://github.com/nikolak/django_reddit

2. Make it work.
   There are a couple bugs in the repo. Depending on your version, you are very likely to occur bugs. We expect you to fix these bugs and make the original code run.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> Make a post with your full name and the date (Jul 04, 2023) or (MMM DD, YYYY) format and send over the screenshot.

3. For Submissions that have URL, the code will automatically direct you to the URL rather than the submissions detail page. We are going to change it. When a user clicks on the submission/post from the home page, it will direct them to the detailed submission page (please find the right views.py function). If a submission has a URL, we will just display the URL as an additional line instead.
   <u> Deliverables:</u> You are going to make two posts, one with a URL and the other one without URL and send over the screenshot.
